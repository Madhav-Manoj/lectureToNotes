# lectureToNotes
This product utilizes OpenAI's Whisper-large-v3-turbo model to automatically convert audio from lectures into accurate, readable text. 
By transcribing spoken content in real time or from recorded sessions, it enables students, educators, and professionals to easily review, 
search, and reference lecture material in written form. This enhances accessibility, supports note-taking, and helps ensure that no important 
information is missed during fast-paced or complex discussions.
